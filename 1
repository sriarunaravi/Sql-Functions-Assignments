SQL Function:
A function in SQL is a stored program that can accept input parameters,perform a specific operation and return a single value.
SQL functions are used to return a value based on the input provided and they can be used in SQL queries just like a regular expression or operator. 
Functions are commonly used for calculations,data transformation or data validation.
